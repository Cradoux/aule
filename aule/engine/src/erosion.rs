//! Erosion helpers (T-100 placeholder).
//!
//! This module is a placeholder for future specialized erosion routines.
//! The MVP orchestrator in `surface` computes slopes, flow routing, and stream-power
//! erosion directly without relying on this module. Kept to satisfy module layout
//! and future expansion.
